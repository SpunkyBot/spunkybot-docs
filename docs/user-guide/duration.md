# Duration Syntax

Many commands have to express the duration. For this purpose, Spunky Bot provides a practical syntax with a suffix for expressing different duration units:

* `s` for second, example: `45s` for 45 seconds
* `m` for minute, example: `75m` for 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 mins)
* `h` for hour, example: `3h` for 3 hours
* `d` for day, example: `2d` for 2 days

If you want to temporary ban Adam for two days with the reason 'insults', use the following command:

!!! example
    `!tempban adam 2d insults`
